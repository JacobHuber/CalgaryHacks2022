# Calgary Hacks 2022 - Tier 1 Fourth Place

[Calgary Hacks 2022](https://calgary-hacks-2022.devpost.com/) was a 24 Hour programming competition following one of three themes. See our project on devpost [here](https://devpost.com/software/homework-please).

## Theme
The theme that our group picked was topic one, to make a *"... game that captures the student experience"*. Our group was competing in Tier 1 of this competition.

## Homework Please - Group 61
The idea we came up with was a darker commentary on student life. It shows the split focus that students under-go and how easy it is to get overwhelmed with responsibilities. Homework Please is a time-management/survival game. Taking inspiration from Papers Please and Undertale, this game has the player managing four unique resource bars that are constantly draining. The player must play minigames that match up with their resource bar to increase it again. As time goes on, the drain on the ability bar increases really putting players to the test.

## Dependencies
This project was created with `Python 3.10` and the graphics library `Pygame 2.1.2`. Python can be installed from its website. Once python is installed pygame can be installed with `> pip install pygame`.


The program's entry point is `main.py`. Game can be ran with `> python3 main.py` or `> python main.py`.
